      "content": "# Snacks: It's not too late for Euro Summer flights\n\n### Procrastinators rejoice: you can still fly to Europe for 15k miles each way\n\n![Shrey G's avatar](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6GnP!,w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F283ff391-4bba-46bc-9cc9-6136829fc4dc_144x144.png)\n\nShrey G\n\nMay 30, 2025\n\n1\n\nHi Shreycationers,\n\nIt’s been a while! I hope you didn’t miss me too much, but rest assured, Shreycation is back and here to stay. In a later post I’ll share a bit more about what I’ve been up to (launching the world’s first hybrid human + AI travel agency, Anecdote Travel!), but for now, there’s something more pressing: helping you get flights for your Europe summer plans.\n\nNothing quite says summer like hopping across the Atlantic to sip an Aperol spritz, but if you’re a procrastinator like me, those flights are getting pricey.\n\n![clear wine glass with orange liquid](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1615830783066-26a99bc9d959?fm=jpg&q=60&w=3000&ixlib=rb-4.1.0&ixid=M3wxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8fA%3D%3D \"clear wine glass with orange liquid\")\n\nI know I can just buy some Aperol from my local Safeway, but it just tastes better in Europe ya feel?\n\nHere’s the price map for roundtrips between San Francisco and various spots in Europe. Big yikes:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!1Xmb!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7afed0cd-955d-4663-842d-71690e2c734b_2212x1580.png)\n\nReally, there’s nothing south of $1000. Fortunately, you read Shreycation and we’ve identified the best opportunities for you to use your points. Here’s how you can get your bank to pick up the tab for your sunny spree on the Spanish coast.\n\n# Air France/KLM Flying Blue\n\nYou may remember my love for the Air France and KLM’s joint program, Flying Blue. Every month, Flying Blue chooses a set of cities to enjoy a promotional discount of 25% off — if you fly from those cities to basically anywhere in Europe, you’ll be able to enjoy the promo rate, if they have availability.\n\nEconomy flights between the USA and Europe cost 25k Flying Blue points one-way usually, so with the 25% discount, you’re looking at 18.75k points instead. And as a cherry on top, if you’ve got a Chase card, Chase Ultimate Rewards currently has a 25% transfer bonus to Flying Blue. **That means you just need to transfer 15k Chase points to Flying Blue** — that’ll get boosted to 18.75k, and you’re looking at a free flight to Europe!\n\nThe current promo cities are also quite convenient for my coastal readers here: **San Francisco, Atlanta, Washington, Miami, Boston**, and even my hometown of **Phoenix** are all getting repped this time! Even some of my readers over in Asia are getting some love, with discount fares from Hong Kong and Singapore. I’ve rarely seen such a convenient set of origin cities for Flying Blue promo award, so take advantage now. (Full list of promo cities here.)\n\nGenerally, I saw a decent amount of availability left for July and August flights. Here’s a sample one I found for SF to Madrid on July 5:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!BWS5!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8c0106fa-d952-4d4f-b2c5-819da41fc74c_1910x754.png)\n\nFlying Blue does charge you for fuel surcharges, so you’ll still owe some money, but it’s still a great deal. Let’s do some quick maths: this flight costs $610 on Google Flights, so after the $120 in surcharges, we’re using 18750 Flying Blue miles to pay for the remaining $490. If you’re transferring from Chase, you’re really only burning 15000 Chase points, so that’s **$490/15000 = 3.2¢/point, more than double what your points are worth in the Chase portal**!\n\nIf you like a little more luxury, business class tickets are 45k points as long as you fly from Montreal — this might be a viable move for my NYC friends here (just grab a cheap NYC > Montreal flight, and fly business across the pond).\n\nA few quick tips for this Flying Blue promotion:\n\n- **The promotion is almost over — May 31 is the last day to book.** However, you can book for any dates up till Oct 31, so there’s no need to fly soon. New promo rates will go live in June, but the origin cities might not be this convenient.\n\n- If you need to change or cancel, it costs 70 EUR. Even if you’re not sure about your trip, given how good the savings are, it might still be worth getting a ticket.\n\n- Even if you don’t live in one of the origin cities, you can just buy a cheap flight to one of those cities, and then fly from there.\n\n- Not all dates will have the promo rates still available. We’re in the last 2 days of this promotion, so many June dates are gone by now, but just use their point calendar at the top of the search screen to locate the 18750 mile fares. It bugs out sometimes when you search roundtrips, so I’d suggest searching one-ways instead.\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading Shreycation! We’re so excited to be back up and running. Subscribe for more, and share with a friend.\n\nShare\n\n---\n\n# Virgin Atlantic\n\nAnother one of my favorite hacks for getting to Europe for cheap is using Virgin Atlantic. For many summer dates, you can fly from NYC to London for just 12k Virgin Atlantic miles. And even better, Chase is also running a 25% transfer bonus for Virgin Atlantic too — you can be in London for just 9600 Chase points.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yqjg!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F31661910-efa0-49b7-8373-1dfb4daa5629_1802x536.png)\n\nNote that Virgin Atlantic does also charge fuel surcharges, but like with Flying Blue, it’s still a great deal. This flight would usually cost $358 on Google Flights, so after deducting the $76 surcharge and factoring in the Chase transfer bonus, you’re getting just shy of **3¢/point**!\n\nAnd if you want to mourn the end of summer with some off-season travel to London, it’s just 6000 Virgin miles for that same flight in September (or just 4800 Chase points)! This is so insanely cheap that I might just buy one of these on impulse.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!j9iX!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb5249792-67e3-4169-a027-0d50aecca370_1884x550.png)\n\nA few quick caveats:\n\n- Here I showed one-ways to London, but the flights from London back to the US can sometimes be surprisingly expensive if you buy them as one-ways rather than as part of a roundtrip ticket. If you fly back from somewhere else in Europe, this isn’t much of a problem.\n\n- Unlike with Flying Blue, these cheaper rates exist mostly just for flights to/from London. If you’re on the west coast, expect to pay a little more (e.g. 15k points).\n\n# Save Money, Travel Well\n\nEven though we’re officially in summer now, doesn’t mean you can’t get some cheap tickets to Europe! Flying Blue and Virgin Atlantic consistently offer some great fares to Europe, and they aren’t slouching one bit for summertime. Chase holders get some extra sprinkles on top with that transfer bonus.\n\nAnd if you’re looking for hotels for Europe, it’s still not too late for that either. At Anecdote, we’ve been handling dozens of summer trips — we can help you find a great hotel and add some awesome perks (free breakfast, room upgrades) to boot.\n\nFind your hotels, hassle-free\n\nThe world of points has changed a lot in the last year, so let me know what you want me to talk about next!\n\nLoading...\n\nAnd if you haven’t yet, subscribe for more travel and points goodness.\n\n1\n\nShare",

      "content": "# Snacks: How to girl math your Lyfts\n\n### Your Lyfts could be free...if you know what you're doing.\n\n![Shrey G's avatar](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6GnP!,w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F283ff391-4bba-46bc-9cc9-6136829fc4dc_144x144.png)\n\nShrey G\n\nApr 06, 2024\n\n2\n\nShare\n\nIt’s Saturday and a lot of you are about to end your night by taking a $50 Lyft back home. Not a fun expense, but saving 20% on it would make it feel a bit better.\n\nThis isn’t a limited time discount — **turns out you can get** ***at least*** **20% off any time on your Lyfts**. It just requires a bit of girl math.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_wwK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcf62150d-3335-4a03-8e1a-da7744265162_1280x768.webp)\n\nIf you’re about to ride one of these in about 6-7 hours from now, listen up! Credit: Solo Traveller\n\nThe Chase Sapphire Reserve earns a whopping 10x points on Lyft rides. Last year I flew a $10000 business class itinerary in United Polaris business class by transferring 99k Chase points to United MileagePlus, garnering a value of 10¢/point. I definitely had some of my Lyfts contribute to those 99k points, and since I earned 10x points and redeemed those points for 10¢ a point, **I effectively got $1 back for every $1 I spent on a Lyft**. **In other words, my Lyfts were free.**\n\nNow a 10¢/point redemption isn’t super common and mostly exists when flying premium cabins, but even if you just redeem on economy flights, you can still get a pretty sizable discount on your Lyfts. At the very least, you can redeem Chase points in the Chase portal directly for 1.5¢/point. But if you transfer those points into airlines, you can easily and routinely get at least 2¢/point. That means you’re effectively earning 20¢ per dollar you spend on Lyft — 20% off!\n\nSo next time it’s late at night and you’re Lyfting back home, know that if you girl math it, you’re at least getting it at a discount.\n\n(*Unfortunately for my Uber loyalists, this arbitrage is a Lyft only thing. The Capital One Savor cards will give you 10% off Ubers, but 10% isn’t the same as 10x points.*)\n\n---\n\nIf you’re subscribed yet, this is your sign. Saving on Lyfts is just the tip of the iceberg. Follow for points tips, tricks, frameworks, and breakdowns that you can actually use.\n\n2\n\nShare",

But looks aren’t everything. Let’s dive in and see what this card is made of.\n\n(It’s made of 17 grams of stainless steel.)\n\n*(Disclaimer: This post is not financial advice and you should do your own research to ensure the cards mentioned in this article are right for you. Applying will likely affect your credit score.)*\n\n# What’s great\n\nFirst things first, Robinhood’s done a great job stealing headlines with this card, and it’s not just all show. This is indeed a wonderfully designed card.\n\n## A simple 3% cash back on everything\n\nEveryone’s talking about the flagship feature, the 3% cash back on everything. **And with good reason: 3% is the highest base cash back rate across any card I’ve seen.** There’s not much else to say here — it’s truly a great cash back rate with no hoops to jump through. There’s something refreshing about the simplicity here, and it’s especially great for beginners.\n\nBut there’s other features that didn’t get as much attention and are also worth highlighting.\n\n## No foreign transaction fees\n\nNo foreign transaction fees means you can truly use this card to earn 3% on *everything*, including that shopping spree in Milan.\n\nWaiving foreign transaction fees used to limited to high annual fee cards, but recently low/no annual fee cards have been introducing it too, including the Apple Card and the Capital One Quicksilver. The Robinhood Gold card is by far the most versatile and valuable of these though. For those who don’t like to carry many cards, you can now ditch whatever low annual fee, no foreign transaction fee card you might have and get 3% on your abroad expenses instead.\n\n## Spend using Virtual Cards\n\nThis is actually the perk I’m most excited for with this card, because as far as I know, **no other card on the market offers native virtual cards**.\n\nVirtual cards let you hide your true credit card number when spending online, and allow you to set an expiry date and spending limit. The killer use case here is managing subscriptions: if you just want 1 month of Hulu to binge Shogun, you can load a virtual card with $8 and have it expire in a month. If you forget to cancel your subscription, it won’t matter; your payment method will be invalid by the month’s end anyway.\n\nVirtual card services like Privacy have existed for a while, but as third party services they’re not as convenient, and their free offerings aren’t as robust as what Robinhood seems to be providing here.\n\n## Surprising amount of protections\n\nThe Robinhood Gold card is part of the Visa Signature family, which comes with various optional benefits that credit card providers can activate. I’m happy to say Robinhood really went for extra credit here; this card is loaded with benefits, including:\n\n- Purchase security: If you buy something nice and it gets lost or stolen in 90 days, you can get up to $1k back.\n\n- Extended warranties: You can extend the warranty of new purchases by up to a year.\n\n- Return protection: If you aren’t satisfied with a recent purchase and the store won’t take it back, you can get reimbursed up to $250.\n\n- Trip cancellation protection: If you get injured before or during a trip, you can get up to $2k to cover nonrefundable arrangements.\n\n- Auto rental collision damage waiver: You can skip the insurance at the rental car office when you use you card to rent.\n\nMany other low annual fee cards have some subset of these perks, but Robinhood is giving you basically everything. If you’ve got premium cards like an Amex platinum, you likely already have access to many of these perks (and with better limits), but this is still spectacular for what is effectively a starter card. The only notable perk that’s missing here is cell phone protection (get reimbursed if your phone is lost/stolen).\n\n## 5% cash back when booking travel\n\n…but that travel has to be booked through Robinhood’s forthcoming travel portal. Now if you’ve used these travel portals through Chase or Amex or other cards, you know these portals aren’t that fun or convenient to use. Also, sometimes these portals don’t have the flights and hotels you’re interested in. Robinhood’s portal isn’t live so it’s hard to make judgements quite yet, but something tells me it won’t be groundbreaking here.\n\n5% cash back has been emerging as a popular number for spend in travel portals, so this number isn’t as groundbreaking as the 3% cash back. You’ll earn the same with a Chase Freedom or a Capital One Quicksilver. But still, 5% is 5%, and it’s good to see Robinhood meeting the industry standard here.\n\n# What’s not so great\n\n## You need Robinhood Gold…and you need to maintain it\n\nThe card’s $0 annual fee branding is a little bit misleading. In order to get the card, you’ll need to be a Robinhood Gold subscriber. But you also need to *maintain* Robinhood Gold to keep the card.\n\nThis will be one of the first times I’ve seen a card’s good standing status tied to some external monthly subscription, and I’m not totally sure how this will work. If you decide not to pause your Robinhood Gold subscription for a month or two, do they close your credit card? Who knows.\n\nFortunately, Robinhood Gold is only $5/month, and if you already invest with Robinhood, it’s a bit of a no brainer: you’ll get a free $1k in margin, lower margin interest rates, 5% on uninvested cash, and more.\n\n## This card earns cash back, not points\n\nIn the world of cash back cards, Robinhood’s 3% universal cash back might as well make it the new king. But cash back cards are the little league since they aren’t nearly as flexible or value as cards earning points. That’s because **the value of cash back is fixed but the value of points is variable**. 1¢ of cash back is 1¢ of cash back and will always be just 1¢ of cash back. But depending on your skill and luck, 1 point could be redeemed for anything from 1¢ to 10¢. That means a card that earns a standard 1x points on everything could be the equivalent of earning 1% to 10% cash back depending on *how you use* those points.\n\nShreycation is all about helping you learn how to use your points well. With some basic knowledge, it’s pretty easy to achieve a rate of at least 2¢/point on virtually all of your award travel redemptions. That means a card like the Chase Freedom Unlimited that earns 1.5x points on everything nets me *at least* 3¢ per dollar I spend. On the other hand, the Robinhood Gold card also earns me 3¢ per dollar, but that’s a hard cap — it’ll *only* earn me 3¢ per dollar.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!_ktO!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7a84cf1d-5774-4839-8f32-2290ced0b357_2728x1466.png)\n\nTwo ways you can spend $100. Obviously taking the cash back option for Chase isn’t the move, but transferring those points into say, United, could get you more value than the Robinhood card gives you. Especially if you use the Chase Freedom Unlimited on dining or drugstores.\n\n## No sign up bonus or intro 0% APR\n\nThe Robinhood Gold account comes with no sign up bonuses or introductory 0% APR rates whatsoever. For other cards in this category, there’s usually a ~$200 sign up bonus, and at least 1 year of 0% APR.\n\nIf you intend on actively using this card for many years, the lack of a bonus might not be a huge issue today, but do note that it’ll take almost $7k in spending to match the free sign up bonus of its peers.\n\nThe bigger issue is the lack of a 0% APR intro period. Right now, if you rack up a $10k balance on a card with 12 months of 0% APR, you can instead invest all that money in a high yield savings account and earn 5% over the course of the year. *That’s basically the equivalent of a 5% cash back on everything*. You’re forgoing that option if you choose to spend more on a Robinhood Gold card.\n\n## A word of caution\n\nThe card has some pretty awesome perks and a killer cash back earning structure today, but these aren’t necessarily guaranteed in the future, especially for younger companies like Robinhood.\n\nWe’ve seen this in the past with cards like the Uber Visa Card, which used to give 4% on dining, 3% on travel, and 2% on Ubers — pretty awesome for a no annual fee card. But over time, the card kept getting nerfed and eventually became less and less compelling until it was finally shuttered.\n\nThat’s not to say this will necessarily happen to the Robinhood card, but it’s good to know that this may not last in perpetuity.\n\n---\n\nIf you’re enjoying our breakdown of the Robinhood Gold card, subscribe for more! I’ll be writing about my favorite underrated cards and hacks to save you money.\n\n---\n\n# Who should actually get this card?\n\n## Beginners and people who don’t wanna deal with points.\n\nBy itself, this card ticks a lot of boxes: great cash back on everything, solid protections, no transaction fees. This makes it an excellent card for beginners.\n\nI’ve waxed poetic about the value of points above, but if care more about simplicity, a card that gives 3% cash back without having to think about it is a pretty solid middle ground. And if you don’t travel much in the first place, you won’t be able to extract much of the value of your points anyway — cash back could be the better option.\n\nThe Robinhood Gold card also effectively renders many other cash back cards obsolete, meaning you can double down on simplicity and get by with fewer cards. Most cash back fans can now get by with just two cards: (1) the Robinhood Gold, and (2) some card that earns 5% on seasonal categories (e.g. Chase Freedom Flex, Discover It).\n\n## People who don’t have a great catch all card yet\n\nA key element of any good personal card portfolio is a “catch all” card that earns > 1% cash back or 1x points on non-category spend. In other words, it’s cool if you have swanky cards that earn 3% on travel and dining (“category spend”), but if you also drop $3000 a year on Rumble Boxing or have a crippling shopping addiction, it would be nice to earn boosted cash back here too.\n\nCatch all cards usually don’t have highly boosted cash back on special categories, but they do have slightly boosted cash back on everything. Up till now, 2% was about the best you could do for a catch all cash back card (RIP Citi Double Cash), but now Robinhood has blown this out of the water with its 3% and is the obvious choice.\n\nThere’s one big caveat: if you have one of the premium travel cards — a Chase Sapphire, Amex Gold or Platinum, or a Capital One Venture — it might make sense to choose a card in those ecosystems as your catch all card. That’s a topic for another Shreycation issue, but generally you’ll get more value (and better purchase protections) on those cards than the Robinhood Gold.\n\n## People who hate taxes but like math\n\nDeath and taxes may be the only two things guaranteed in life, but the Robinhood card can help you *reduce* your annual subscription to Uncle Sam.\n\nThe IRS lets you pay your outstanding taxes using a credit card. They’ll charge you 1.8% for this privilege, but if you’re using a card that gives you 3% cash back…you see where I’m going here.\n\n**Courtesy of Robinhood, you can now enjoy a 1.2% discount on income taxes you pay directly**. If most of your income comes from W-2 earnings, your employer is already withholding most of your income taxes for you and you’re likely not paying much on tax day, meaning this hack probably won’t be as useful. But if you have lots of 1099 earnings (e.g. from freelancing or side gigs), have high capital gains, or own a business and pay quarterly taxes, you’re usually paying a large chunk of your tax liability directly. By using the Robinhood Gold card to pay, **you** **could keep hundreds of extra dollars in your pocket**.\n\nWe can go one step further for a really cheeky version of this hack. Since you’re paying taxes with a credit card, you have at least a whole month to pay down the balance while avoiding an interest charge. So maybe instead of paying down the card immediately, **stick that tax money in a 5% APY high yield savings account for a month**, and then pay your card. 5% APY earned for one month translates to a ~0.4% ROI, boosting your effective tax discount to 1.6%.\n\n*You can also do this hack with the Paypal Mastercard (which gives you 3% cash back on Paypal transactions), but the Robinhood Gold card is a way more versatile card to have in your wallet*.\n\n---\n\nIf you’ve decided the Robinhood Gold is the way to go for you, you can use the link below to add yourself to the waitlist.

Some awesome stuff coming soon, but for now, a nice ol’ bag of snacks.\n# Alaska Airlines Joins Bilt\n\nAlaska Airlines has some of the best redemptions in the market, but they’ve always been so hard to claim since Alaska wasn’t a transfer partner of any major credit card. Read: if you want Alaska miles, you gotta fly Alaska.\n\\*\\*That changed last week, when Bilt signed on Alaska as a transfer partner.\\*\\* I swear, I’m not sponsored by Bilt but they do keep rolling out the hits. I’m actually surprised they managed to make this partnership work, but they also did manage to break through with American Airlines, and American + Alaska have their own partnership too now … maybe just a simple matter of 2 + 2.\nAlaska Airlines’ Mileage Plan program has a couple awesome attributes:\n\n- You can book flights across all of oneworld (e.g. American, British Airways, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines, Qatar, Qantas, Iberia) AND their non-alliance partners (e.g. Korean Air, Singapore Airlines, LATAM). This list covers some of the best airlines in the world!\n\n- You can book free stopovers even on one-way awards. If you don’t know what a stopover is, I’ve written extensively about them before — it’s your way to turn a single trip into multiple for free.\n![The Complete Guide to Japan Airlines First Class | Prince of Travel](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!KnY-!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0348fd0-f9d2-48e9-af42-4614d4610630\\_1000x667.jpeg \"The Complete Guide to Japan Airlines First Class | Prince of Travel\")\nAlaska Airlines Mileage Plan is one of the most popular ways to book premium cabins on Japan Airlines (credit: Prince of Travel)\nHere’s how you can use all this to your advantage. Let’s say you want to do a huge Asia trip. You can book NYC <> HKG (Hong Kong) with a stopover in Tokyo on the way there and another stopover in Singapore on the way back. This would usually cost you 152k miles if you booked every leg individually, but thanks to the free stopover policy, you only spend 108k miles. Valuing your miles at 2¢/point, that’s $880 saved on a 3 destination Asia trip.\n\\*H/t to my buddy Sweyn for sending me this even before it came up on my news feed.\\*\n# Check if you’re on a Boeing plane\n\nBoeing has been in the news for all the wrong reasons lately. I won’t care to speculate on the causes here, but even though air travel remains remarkably safe, it’s understandable if you to avoid Boeing so you can sleep better on your flight.\nIf you’ve got a flight coming up, \\*\\*you can check out amiflyingonaboeing.com, made by yours truly to quickly check what aircraft you’re flying on.\\*\\*\n# 50% off London flights via Virgin Atlantic\n\nVirgin Atlantic has a 50% off deal on all award flights from the US to the UK \\*\\*ending midnight tonight\\*\\*!\nThat means for a sample NYC <> LHR trip:\n\n- economy roundtrips start from 10k miles (usually 20k)\n\n- premium economy roundtrips start from 17.5k miles (usually 35k)\n\n- business economy roundtrips start from 47.5k miles (usually 95k)\nNote that this only applies to flights on Virgin Atlantic itself, and must involve trips that complete before June 30.\nNow there is one somewhat unfortunate issue preventing this from being one of the greatest points deals this year. Virgin Atlantic charges fuel surcharges on award flights, meaning you can’t just focus on the miles cost. For example, a roundtrip starting May 10th requires 10k Virgin miles + $492, but the equivalent “Economy Classic” ticket would cost $667. That still values your miles at 1.75¢/point (($667 - $492) / 10000), but it’s not amazing. Premium economy gives you some better value, at 3.1¢/point (would usually cost $1773 in cash).\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!uZae!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7b11bb76-2b02-49bd-96f6-09df5cfcf81a\\_2350x622.png)\nSample roundtrip for NYC <> LHR for May 10 - May 14\n\\*\\*But there’s a hack\\*\\*. I won’t get into the weeds here, but often you can \\*\\*get cheaper fuel surcharges if you book two separate one-way tickets rather than one roundtrip.\\*\\* For example, here’s what happens if I book the same premium economy itinerary, but as two one ways.\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!xjDz!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F91403a4e-33b6-4153-a621-2b4b92b2f6e5\\_2354x622.png)\nOutbound flight\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!6hI4!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc74c9cb1-94b7-4058-ba8e-b53d68894cb6\\_2344x606.png)\nReturn flight\nNote the points cost remains the same: 8.75k + 8.75k = 17.5k miles. But the fuel surcharge is cheaper; instead of $1227, it’s $453 + £394, which converts to $957. \\*\\*You save $270 literally by clicking some buttons differently.\\*\\*\n\\*Wait I don’t have Virgin Atlantic miles though\\*\\*\\*.\\*\\* Oh my friend, you most definitely do. Virgin Atlantic partners with \\*\\*every\\*\\* major card program, so transfer away. (If you ever forget who transfers to who, I’ve made a super nice diagram here.)\n\\*What if I’m not ready to commit to a flight now?\\* It’s inconvenient that this deal expires tonight. But you can always change your flight for $50. You can also cancel at least 24 hrs before the flight to get your miles and taxes back. Fuel surcharges should also be refunded in most cases.\n# Use AirTags to save your bags\n\nOne of my favorite travel hacks is sticking an AirTag in your luggage. There’s nothing like having peace of mind that your checked bags have truly made it onto the plane! And if something goes wrong, you have some reference of where your bag might be.\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!wWOh!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F99a9feb3-5015-4ead-b246-38a7cc20c86a\\_1170x2532.png)\nSince chances are someone handling your bag has an iPhone, you can usually track your bag’s journey in granular detail. Also, as soon as you log onto inflight wifi with an iPhone, chances are some other iPhone user is sitting just above where your bag is in the cargo hold, and you can make sure your bag is happily enjoying its flight too 😄\nAirTags are on discount right now too! AirTags usually cost $100 for a set of 4, but Amazon is selling them for $80 right now.\n\n---\nThanks for reading! I know I’ve been away for a while; I’ve been gearing up for a launch that’s very near and dear to my heart, and you’ll be hearing it first here.\nI’ve also got so many awesome in-depth articles planned for the coming weeks, including how to hack basic economy, the (\\*only\\*) hotel program that’s worth pursuing, and a framework on how to actually think about using your points.

      "content": "# How to actually transfer your points\n\n### A button by button tutorial\n\n![Shrey G's avatar](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!6GnP!,w_36,h_36,c_fill,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F283ff391-4bba-46bc-9cc9-6136829fc4dc_144x144.png)\n\nShrey G\n\nFeb 16, 2024\n\n5\n\nHi Shreycationers,\n\nWe’ve been talking a lot about how you can use your credit card points to get outsized value on your points. Instead of just getting 1¢/point, you can squeeze out 3x, 5x, or even 10x the value just by transferring your points into airline mileage programs to book “award travel.” This also lets you book free flights on airlines where you might not otherwise have any miles; just transfer them over from a card! There are entire forums dedicated to going down the rabbit hole on strategies for optimally deploying your points.\n\nBut if it’s your first rodeo, you’re probably hung up on a more fundamental question: *how do I actually move the points from one program to another?* The UIs for many of these credit card and airlines program are historically a bit lacking, so the process can be unintuitive.\n\nSo without further ado, a play by play guide on how to actually transfer your points.\n\n# Step 0: Identify your redemption\n\nOne of my dear Shreycation readers was recently fed up with the 29 degree weather in NYC and needed to escape somewhere warm. He wanted to book a flight to Hawaii, so I helped him through the process. Now I’ll be walking you through that same process in this issue.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!pxUe!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1de844ec-1dcc-4276-9d5e-2342e1363f3f_2000x1367.jpeg)\n\nWay better than 6 inches of snow…\n\nBefore we can book our travel using points, we must pinpoint available award seats that can be redeemed with an airline's mileage program. It’s essential to ensure this award space exists **BEFORE** we transfer points from your credit card, as once points are transferred, there's no going back. **Point transfers are one-way and irreversible.** Finding ideal award space is the subject of Shreycation issues past, present, and future, but for the purpose of this example, we’ll work with one of my favorite award redemption paths.\n\nI’ve previously talked about how you can book dirt cheap domestic flights on United Airlines by redeeming miles in the Turkish Airlines Miles & Smiles program. (Turkish and United are partners, meaning I can redeem Turkish points on a United ticket.) Traveling to Hawaii counts as domestic travel in Turkish’s eyes, so we can take advantage of a sweet spot here and book a EWR (Newark) to HNL (Honolulu) flight for a very cheap 10k Turkish miles. (Booking this flight directly with United would cost 30k+ United miles.)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!GvCH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc80d0bdf-566a-4914-a443-a707040a7a06_2138x394.png)\n\nHard to see in this image, but there’s a very tiny little United logo in the search result that indicates this is a partner flight.\n\nNow I don’t have any Turkish miles since I rarely fly on Turkish in the first place, but there’s where our credit card points come in. *We can mint miles in Turkish by transferring from points from a card.*\n\n# Step 1: Transfer the points\n\nNow that you know where you want to redeem your points, go to your credit card rewards portal to start the transfer. You’re looking for a button that says something like “*Transfer points.*” Note that you do NOT want to go through their “*Book travel*” feature; this is for booking travel on cash (or using your credit card points directly, which is usually a pretty poor use of points).\n\n*Some quick links to your rewards portal: Chase, Amex, Capital One, Citi, Bilt (use app)*\n\nHere’s where to find the magic “transfer points” button in a few major card portals:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!neg_!,w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2864faff-9773-4762-9fe0-a4c86d7f0d46_2198x1344.png)![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yzJj!,w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fabe4c770-c73e-4faf-8c74-071a4ab2c6d1_2054x1754.png)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!n1Aw!,w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F83309bad-2b8f-40b8-aba0-9e5114209fba_1170x2532.png)![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!D5lv!,w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F3808ecad-40ae-4ca1-b878-39b0b7b7084d_1170x1537.png)\n\nHow to access the point transfer feature in various credit card rewards portals. In order: Chase, Amex, Bilt. Don't click the buttons marked with a red X; these are for regular cash travel. Tap images to see in more detail.\n\n## Confirm your credit card is partnered with your desired airline mileage program\n\nNot all airlines are partnered with all credit card partners, so you’ll first need to make sure you use a credit card that can transfer to your desired airline mileage program. (This is also why I recommend having cards in multiple programs, even if it’s the entry level cards!)\n\nHere’s a handy diagram I made for y’all to see all the transfer partners at a glance:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ouVU!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8bb7a61a-08e5-4c7b-81f0-75b733913659_2077x2338.png)\n\nPrint or download this for future reference! I made this diagram because I couldn’t find anything like it on the web.\n\nGoing back to our EWR-HNL example, we’re booking through Turkish Airlines, so according to the diagram above, I’d need to use Bilt, Capital One, or Citi to transfer points. If I go the “Transfer” tab in the Bilt app, I can scroll down and select Turkish:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PRds!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7f569a68-b0dd-415a-9d64-5b247ad622b0_1170x2532.png)\n\nIf you haven’t made an account with the target mileage program yet, you’ll need to do that first and enter your account number when transferring.\n\n## Calculate how many points you need to transfer\n\nMost of the time, this is dead simple. **The vast majority of points transfer tend to be at a 1:1 ratio, so if you need 10k airline miles, just transfer 10k credit card points.** That means I just need to transfer 10k Bilt points into Turkish Airlines to book my EWR-HNL flight.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!xDsJ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe7680bf0-1d62-427f-90fb-ee6ad605baf2_1170x1772.png)\n\nA few caveats:\n\n- There are some rare exceptions to the 1:1 transfer ratio, like transferring to EVA Air via Capital One.\n\n- Credit card programs often run *transfer bonuses* where you get **more miles per point you transfer.** You can takeadvantage of these bonuses to get hilariously cheap award travel, like many Shreycation readers did on Air Canada earlier this month. Bilt is renowned for their killer 75-150% transfer bonuses on the 1st of each month, and other programs like Chase and Amex have run 30-60% bonuses in the past.\n\n---\n\nLearning how to finally use that small fortune of points you’ve been sitting on? Send this article to a friend who desperately needs some help! (We have a referral program here at Shreycation that’ll score you some dope content and perks; use the button below to make sure your referral counts.)\n\nRefer a friend\n\n---\n\n# Step 2: Wait\n\n**Many point transfers are nearly instant.** Once you’ve triggered the request from the credit card portal, you can usually make a quick coffee and by the time you’re back, the miles will be credited to your airline mileage account.\n\nFor example, my points took 10 minutes to transfer from Bilt to Turkish, and I got an email confirmation from Bilt telling me the deed was done.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!i-Nd!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcbda4d3f-76f6-47d4-bff3-0b73a24194c2_1170x2532.png)\n\nAfter 10 mins of waiting, I got an email from Bilt…\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!W_xZ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F51587cae-2294-4c9b-aae5-0017b306ae3f_1548x836.png)\n\nAnd sure enough, they’re right there in my Turkish account!\n\nSometimes, the transfers can take longer though. For example, transferring Bilt points to American AAdvantage or Amex points to Singapore KrisFlyer can take up to 24 hours. Good award tickets tend to go away quickly, so if you’re dealing with a partner that has a transfer delay, you can often call up the airline to “hold” the award for you. This lets you rest easy knowing someone else won’t swoop your spot just because your points were in transit.\n\n# Step 3: Book it\n\nNow that you’ve transferred the points, you can return back to the portal for the airline you’re booking through and complete your booking!\n\n## Wait why am I being charged cash too?\n\nOften when booking award travel, you might notice you’ll still need to enter your credit card and pay some cash. This is because most award travel has a few taxes and surcharges, on top of the miles you’re redeeming. You can’t pay for these extra fees in miles unfortunately.\n\nThe surcharges vary pretty significantly across different mileage programs. Some programs like United charge a nominal amount of $5.60 (to cover the TSA security fee). However, others may charge you the dreaded “fuel surcharge”, a fee that often scales by distance and cabin class and can add hundreds to the flight cost. Air France is known for doing this:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!zPzf!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdce16619-4a24-48d1-af3c-1d5a5259f878_2114x460.png)\n\nSample economy class award from Air France with a hefty $166 fuel surcharge.\n\nSince these fuel surcharges can be hefty, it’s important to consider those when valuing your redemption — spending 27k miles to get a $400 flight for free is less compelling if you’re spending $170 in surcharges.\n\nLoading...\n\n# Step 4: Manage your flight\n\nNow that you have your flight booked, you might be wondering how to manage your flight (e.g. check in, change your seat, upgrade, etc.). This differs based on whether you booked your award directly with the airline or if you booked via a partner.\n\n## If you booked an award with the airline directly\n\nIf you booked an award ticket with the same airline that’s operating the flight (e.g. you booked on United and you’re flying United), *it’s business as usual*. Once you book, you’ll already see your flight linked to your mileage account and in your app, no action required. You’ll also be able to change seats, upgrade, check in, etc. like it’s a normal flight. If you have an issue, you just take it up with the airline.\n\n## If you booked an award via a partner\n\nIn our example though, we’re using Turkish to book a ticket on a United flight, so things get a little more complicated since there’s 2 airlines involved: the one we booked from (Turkish), and the one we’re actually flying (United). Upon booking, Turkish will send me an email with a confirmation number.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qpAQ!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F218697eb-ad5f-4262-bdc7-0130bad2150b_1548x642.png)\n\nFAKENO is a dummy reference number for example sake.\n\nNow I can enter that confirmation on the United website and it should link the reservation to my MileagePlus account (sometimes you may need to contact them if this doesn’t work automatically though). United may assign me a different confirmation number than the one Turkish gave me, but rest assured, it’s the same flight.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PvrK!,w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F87782c00-c40e-4538-92bf-bd06d4dacd63_1170x2532.png)![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!jw2W!,w_720,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F82fc2495-6e26-45ba-839d-9194378f2019_1179x2556.png)\n\nOn the left, I opened the United app and linked my trip to my United account using the code Turkish gave me. On the right, you can see United successfully retrieved my flight details.\n\n**Since I have United status, linking my trip to my United account lets me enjoy my United perks on the flight** (e.g. picking a Economy Plus seat for free). To be clear, I won’t earn any United miles or status points on this flight, but I will get to enjoy my existing perks.\n\n*What if I need to make changes or need customer support*? **If you need help with the booking (e.g. cancel/change flight), contact the airlines you booked through** (Turkish in this case)**. If you need help with the flight (delays, missed flight, seat change), contact the airline you’re actually flying on** (United in this case).\n\n# Putting it together\n\nWe’ve now gone through the full process of transferring points to get killer redemptions. It may seem like a lot at first, but after a few redemptions, it’ll be second nature to you!\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, this article is inspired by an actual Hawaii trip I was helping a Shreycation reader with. **The golden rule of free travel is to earn lots of points per dollar and redeem them for lots of cents per point.** Using tips and tricks we’ve covered in previous issues, he executed this to a T. He earned 10k miles from a single fancy dinner with friends because he took advantage of a whopping 16x bonus on Bilt Dining on the 1st of the month. He then identified a Turkish airlines redemption for his Hawaii trip for just 10k miles. **Just by strategically earning and deploying points, his one dinner from 2 months ago paid for his Hawaii flight today.** (That flight would have cost $775 by the way. That’s 7.75¢/point — insane value, especially for economy.)\n\n# Note for the Eagle Eyed: Turkish Devaluations\n\nThose of you who have been following along with previous Shreycation issues might have noticed that the Turkish redemption here is 2.5k miles more than expected. After all, just 1 month ago I wrote that all domestic redemptions were 7.5k miles. Unfortunately, this week Turkish has finally succumbed to inflation the same way United and many others have, and they made various routes more expensive (sometimes as much as 90% higher). The silver lining is domestic trip awards only increased 33% from 7.5k to 10k, so it’s still one of the best deals out there for domestic travel.\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading! I know it’s been a minute. I’ve been working on something new and exciting in the travel space, and y’all will be the first to hear about it once it’s up. It’s the culmination of months of work, and I’m excited to share it soon!\n\nShreycation has received so much love and support from y’all, and I’d love to keep that going.

Makes it worth getting Bilt status!\n\\*\\*I want to emphasize how crazy this deal is.\\*\\* In the past, programs like Chase have offered a 20% bonus; even the lowest-tier Bilt members get almost 4 times that here!\n\\*\\*Now here’s how you turn that into the cheapest cross-country flight I’ve ever seen.\\*\\* We can go on the Air Canada Aeroplan site and look up EWR <> SFO flights on March 5 and we’ll see these options:\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!UHRM!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F7d29b452-773e-4388-bea9-075f17498807\\_840x478.png)\nThis is a live example, and chances are you’ll still be able to book it on Feb 1.\nFlying cross-country takes 12.5k Aeroplan miles on a typical day, which usually means transferring 12.5k Bilt points. But on Feb 1 we’re armed with a huge transfer bonus from Bilt,which meansit could cost \\*\\*as low as 12.5/2.5 = 5k Bilt points\\*\\* if you’re Bilt Platinum. But even if you’re just Bilt Blue, it’s still just 7.2k points — strictly better than transferring 7.5k points to Turkish! \\*Also, the cash value of regular economy on these flights is $165. \\*\\*That values your Bilt points as much as 3.3¢/point.\\*\\* That’s pretty darn good, especially for economy!\\*\n\\*\\*This deal is ONLY available on Feb 1,\\*\\* so make sure not to miss out! Aeroplan is quickly becoming one of the most compelling Star Alliance programs, and I’m not sure when we’ll be lucky enough to see an Aeroplan bonus this crazy again.\nSubscribe so you can stay in the know next time a great deal comes around!\n\\*But Shrey, I can’t really commit to a flight today.\\* That’s fine! All you need to do on Feb 1 is transfer some miles. You can book later.\n\\*Do Aeroplan miles expire?\\* That is a great question. Aeroplan miles do expire 18 months after you receive them, but only if you have zero activity on your Aeroplan account. Basically anything you do with Aeroplan resets the clock, \\*including transferring more points\\*. So if you’re worried about forgetting, you can add yourself to this calendar invite for July 2025, which will remind you to transfer the minimal amount of points to Aeroplan to delay expiration.\n\\*Is NYC <> SFO the only good route to book?\\* Nope! You can use this transfer bonus to book any of the awesome routes in the bonus snack below.\n\n---\nIf this article made you curious about the Bilt card, you can learn more in my review here. If you do end up getting it, I would appreciate you using my referral link. It gets me some extra points which I can use to power more issues of Shreycation!\nApply for Bilt\n\\*(Disclaimer: This post is not financial advice and you should do your own research to ensure this card is right for you. Applying will likely affect your credit score.)\\*\n\n---\n# Bonus Snack: Air Canada vs. United\n\nYou know how your Chipotle bowl costs 20% more because of inflation? Turns out points are affected by inflation too, and in summer 2023, United \\*devalued\\* their points program. Routes that may have cost just 35k United miles now cost upwards of 55k. This opens the field for other programs to offer some great deals.\n\\*\\*United MileagePlus used to be one of the most cost-effective ways to book many Star Alliance flights on points, but now Air Canada Aeroplan is eyeing that crown.\\*\\* Let’s analyze some of the most popular travel routes:\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s\\_!9tHD!,w\\_1456,c\\_limit,f\\_auto,q\\_auto:good,fl\\_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4ba9730d-361e-43a8-9b5e-3d25caa00170\\_1386x572.png)\n\\*\\*Aeroplan outperforms in the vast majority of routes except for West Coast <> Europe.\\*\\* Especially great savings come from the short-haul North American routes, North America <> West/South Asia routes, and North America <> South America routes.\nLoading...\nEagle-eyed readers will notice that Air Canada levies higher cash fees on their award flights. But don’t worry, the math is mathing. Let’s take North America <> East Asia for example: 50k miles + 77 CAD on Aeroplan vs. 55k miles + 6 USD on United. 77 CAD is about 56 USD, meaning there’s a difference of +50 USD and -5k miles between the two. 5k miles is worth just 50 USD \\*only if you’re a points novice and value each mile at 1¢/point.\\* But the whole point of Shreycation is to help you get way more value from your points than the default 1¢/point, so just by subscribing, you’re making those 5k miles worth way more than 50 USD! The math indeed maths.\nAnd if you’re wondering why the Delhi route is so cheap, it’s because Air Canada considers India part of the “Atlantic” region, along with all of Europe and Africa. Air Canada is filled with fun sweet spots like this that I’ll cover in depth in the future.\n\n---\nThanks for reading! Wielding the point-hacking force is a lot more fun with friends.

It’s called a **stopover**, and it’s the easiest hack for adding an extra stop to your itinerary.\n\nHere’s how it works. Let’s say I’m traveling from NYC to Delhi during mid March. There’s a $411 option that involves connecting through Abu Dhabi (AUH) with a 3.5 hour layover:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fyDy!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F63ad1b7c-a6f3-464f-9eff-75d2c4e36c8e_2086x932.png)\n\nBut Abu Dhabi is beautiful and maybe I’m not quite satisfied just exploring the airport — after all, if I’m connecting through Abu Dhabi anyway, I might as well stay there for a few nights and explore! This mean I need to book 2 separate one-way trips (JFK > AUH, AUH > DEL), but that costs a total of $802; almost double my original itinerary price!\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!PEr6!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcace59cb-c0e5-48c9-8774-77a7f70799e9_2082x496.png)\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!4uy_!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F18f424cb-fbfe-42f8-8931-b9b578451844_2082x504.png)\n\nHere’s the secret galaxy brain travelers know: **Etihad has a free stopover program where they’ll let you book an itinerary with a multi-day Abu Dhabi stay in between, but without the extra markup + taxes from booking two separate one-way trips.** In other words, Etihad will just pretend you’ve booked a single trip (NYC-DEL in this case) that just happens to have a verrrrryyy long connection in their home city (AUH). Getting this free stopover is easy; I simply go to the Etihad site and check the box saying I’d like a free stopover:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!3yvc!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc681653e-fdb7-4618-ad5d-dee4c56a440a_1292x1138.png)\n\nThis gives me access to a new itinerary option that costs $434, **almost the same price as my original itinerary**, but with one big difference: **I get a 48 hr connection time rather than just 3.5 hrs.** And obviously, I’m more than welcome to leave the airport and explore the city during that time.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lGHP!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26827f5a-e01e-45e3-b997-fefcf370a9a5_1834x200.png)\n\nSo far, Etihad has subsidized my airfare by effectively treating my two separate trips as if it were just one. But Etihad goes one step further and actually **comps my hotel for up to 2 nights!** Etihad will let you choose from one of nine 3-star partner hotels for your complimentary stay (usually would cost $60-$100/night). Etihad also gives you the option to upgrade your stay by giving you deep 40% discounts on bougie 5-star hotels like the Shangri-La Qaryat Al Beri or the Grand Hyatt Abu Dhabi (details here).\n\nLet’s recap. I was going from NYC to Delhi but noticed I had a connection in AUH. Initially I was going to just rot at my gate for a lackluster 3.5 hr layover, but **because of Etihad’s stopover program, I’m actually able to explore the glory of Abu Dhabi for 2 nights for practically the same cost**! That’s 2 trips for the price of one! (If you’re doing the math, between the subsidized airfare and the free hotels, that one little stopover checkbox on the Etihad site has **saved me over $500**.)\n\n![Abu Dhabi - What you need to know before you go – Go Guides](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!w4Jw!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdb0ccbfe-a3cc-420e-9eb1-770e9d8bf5e9_800x533.jpeg \"Abu Dhabi - What you need to know before you go – Go Guides\")\n\nLiterally get to spend 48 hours exploring these tall buildings at practically no extra cost, all thanks to stopovers.\n\nInspired to enjoy a free stopover with a friend? Let them know!\n\nShare\n\n## Quick Vocab Note: Layover vs Stopover\n\nLayovers are less than 24hrs in length, and usually don’t involve leaving the airport. The vast majority of flight connections are layovers — you’re just there as a means to an end.\n\nStopovers are usually 24hrs or more, and involve you intentionally leaving the airport to explore the city. The connecting city becomes a destination in and of itself.\n\nSome stopover programs require you to contact customer support, so knowing the difference and using precise language with the support rep can expedite your process.\n\n## Why do free stopovers even exist?\n\nAs you saw in the Etihad example, stopovers save you a ton of money on multi-city trips. But why does Etihad care about subsidizing your travel like this? Why do free stopover programs even exist? To answer these questions, we need a quick airlines industry lesson.\n\nMany of the world’s major airlines are at least partially, if not majority-owned by their home government. The Singaporean government’s investment arm, Temasek, owns 56% of Singapore Airlines. TAP Portugal was swallowed up by the Portuguese government in 2020 when they bought out 72.5% of the carrier — the list goes on. These nationalized carriers are often called “flag carriers.”\n\nMost governments have an active interest in boosting tourism to their nation. Since they have a majority stake in their flag carriers, foreign governments can use them to incentivize impulse visits by implementing stopover programs. So when Etihad offers you a free stopover in Abu Dhabi, you’re getting your travels subsidized by the Emirati government in the hope that you’ll come again and maybe even tell your friends. Talk about customer acquisition cost…\n\n*This concept might be a bit foreign to us in the USA; the airlines industry was deregulated and privatized in America in the 70s, so the USA doesn’t have official “flag carriers” that have the US government’s investment and blessing. For my international readers, that means stopovers in the US aren’t really a thing (although there is a hack that I’ll share in a future Shreycation Snack!).*\n\n## Five awesome stopover programs\n\nThere’s a ton of stopover programs out there, and they all vary in their perks, pricing, and how long you’re allowed to stay. Most aren’t as generous as Etihad and won’t comp your hotel, but in all cases, **the programs below will let you stay a few days in their host city without needing to book separate one-way tickets**, which saves you some dough. Other programs let you do free stopovers, but only on award tickets (i.e. tickets you buy using points/miles).\n\nGoing through all the stopover programs is beyond the scope of this article, but I will introduce a few fan favorites:\n\n### **Turkish Airlines**\n\nLike Etihad, Turkish also gives you a truly free stopover experience with hotels and all. The rules are a little more specific though: you need to have already booked a route with a 20hr+ layover in Istanbul (IST). If you are, you’re entitled to (a) stopover without increasing your airfare and (b) one night in a 4-star hotel if you’re flying economy, or two nights in a 5-star hotel if you’re flying business! This can be a fantastic way to explore one of the world’s oldest and most historic cities.\n\nAs always though, Turkish is a little behind the times on technology. There may be little indication during the booking process that your flight is eligible, and you’ll need to contact them via email to actually arrange your stopover (it’s not an automatic process like others on this list).\n\n*What if my layover is less than 24 hours?* Well turns out Turkish still has something for ya! If your layover is 6-20 hrs, Turkish offers layover service! You can just hit up a “TourIstanbul” counter during your layover and they’ll put you on a tour bus and show you around and give you a meal for free. If you’re at the upper end of this layover range (12+ hrs), Turkish will let you relax in a hotel for free too (think of this as “Stopover-Lite”).\n\nLinks: Stopovers, TourIstanbul, Layover hotels\n\n### JAL\n\nJapan Airlines will let you spend 1-6 nights in Tokyo or Osaka. If you’re heading to say, Niseko for skiing this season, might as well throw in a stop at Tokyo! Technically, you should be able to use Japan Airlines’ multicity booking tool to just specify your desired stopover, and it should give you the same price as with a non-stopover itinerary. In practice, JAL’s tech isn’t that great, so sometimes you’ll see the price jump. No worries though; you can call up their booking agents and they can set up the stopover without the price difference.\n\n---\n\n**I’m working on a definitive guide to stopovers** that covers all the carriers that offer free stopovers, and the easiest way to book them. As you’ve seen above, stopover programs have various rules and quirks, but I’m working on compiling those in one place for you. If you refer 3 new subscribers to Shreycation, **I’ll send it to you for free**! Make sure to use the share button below (or the one earlier in this post), or your referral may not count.\n\nRefer a friend\n\n---\n\n### TAP Portugal\n\nTAP Portugal has been gaining popularity these days as one of the cheapest ways to fly to Europe on cash. If you’ve taken one of these flights, you know that you’ll likely layover in Lisbon or Porto. But you can also *stopover* in these cities for up to 10 days! TAP makes it super easy to book these directly on their site.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ZaAM!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F03c34dc5-2b02-4283-89be-349a72bc04e0_1434x1380.png)\n\nThis pops up right when you search on the official TAP Portugal site; so easy.\n\nAlso, TAP will give you 25% off airfare to other Portugal destinations during your stopover, including exotic getaways like the Azores!\n\n### Singapore\n\nIf you’re flying into Asia, you can add a free stopover in Singapore *as long as you’re booking using Singapore KrisFlyer miles* (sorry, no free stopovers on cash tickets)*.* For example if I want to fly SFO > BKK (Bangkok), that would cost 42k miles each way on Singapore Airlines, with a connection in SIN (Singapore). In theory, if I wanted to build in my own SIN stopover on miles, I’d actually need to book 3 flights on miles: SFO > SIN (42k), SIN > BKK (13k), BKK > SFO (42k), total of 95k miles. But since Singapore has a free stopover program, that SIN > BKK flight basically becomes free, and I save 13k miles!\n\nNote that you get 1 free stopover if you book a *roundtrip* saver award, or 1 free stopover on a one-way advantage award (saver, as the name suggests, is a cheaper award that has limited capacity). Also, Singapore doesn’t give complimentary hotels, but they do offer deep discount stopover packages that include accommodations, transportation, and attraction tickets.\n\n*But Shrey, I don’t have KrisFlyer miles!* Yes you do. Every major card program except Bilt transfers points into Singapore KrisFlyer. If you’re not sure what that means, check out my breakdown on transfer partners!\n\n*What if I have a long layover in SIN but I don’t want to stopover?* SIN is widely considered the world’s best airport and there’s so much to do there (I almost missed a connection because I was too engrossed), but if you do want to get out, Singapore does offer free 2.5hr tours if your layover is 5.5hrs or longer.\n\n![Singapore skyline at night, with Marina Bay Sands in foreg… | Flickr](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!WJ6a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F26355630-4dc1-446a-8112-7156ff7b4549_1023x678.jpeg \"Singapore skyline at night, with Marina Bay Sands in foreg… | Flickr\")\n\nSingapore is probably one of my favorite cities in the world; you bet I’m taking a free stopover there if I can get it. Photo: Nicolas Lannuzel\n\n### Air France/KLM Flying Blue\n\nI’ve written about the Flying Blue frequent flyer program before, and it’s truly the gift that keeps on giving. Let’s say you wanted to book an economy ticket *on points* from Toronto (YYZ) to Rome (FCO) for the Italian summer. Flying Blue currently has promo fares for routes involving Toronto, so you’d get a great rate; just 22k miles for YYZ > FCO on KLM, connecting through Amsterdam (AMS). But we can stretch our miles even further and make our AMS layover into an AMS stopover at no extra points cost!\n\nUnfortunately, you do have to book these over the phone, as their online award search tool doesn’t let you book multi-city itineraries. But Flying Blue makes up for it with the most liberal stopover policies of any other program on this list: **you can stopover in ANY of the connecting cities on ANY of their partners.** Flying Blue has 34 partners (including SkyTeam airlines like Delta and Virgin Atlantic), so you could do stopovers anywhere from LHR to HKG to CDG to GRU (Sao Paolo) and more. This is in stark contrast with other programs that only let you stopover in the carrier’s host country. Also, they let you spend up to 12 months on you stopovers; great for digital nomads!\n\n---\n\nThanks for reading!
